About

latex-helper replaces basic latex-like syntax with a wave equivalent. Converts (a lot of) the latex special characters and subscript and superscript. Works as a companion to latex gadgets when the full functionality of latex math rendering is not required.
The bot is lives at latex-helper@appspot.com
Use it with the robot at eqybot@appspot.com which gives full latex gadgets when more complex formatting is required

To use the robot write:
_ for subscript
^ for superscript
¬¬ to go back to regularscript once something has been formatted
\alpha etc for special characters

For example:
\alpha_1^3+\beta=\gamma

If you want to convert latex to be used in a wave. Use a latex -> html converter on the source file. Then copy this into a wave, and use this tool, eqybot and other wave functionality to continue working.

Codewords convert when the next character is not a lower-case letter, as in the above example. If you want, you can end code words with ; so they change when the next character is a lower-case letter, and the ; will be removed
TODO

Ensure support of all latex special characters. I just need a more complete latex to unicode dictionary than I currently have
